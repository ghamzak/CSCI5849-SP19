    <h1>Designing an AAC for a specific context</h1>
    <h3>Context:</h3>
    <p>Talking to medical professionals</p>
    <h3>Challenges:</h3>
    <p>In the context of talking to a doctor, one challenge is describing the problem, say,
      without the ability to point to a particular body part where you have the problem.
      Also, just like any other talking context, talking itself would be a problem, and more than
      the initial problem description, the patient would have difficulty in answering
      the doctor’s questions.</p>
    <h3>Design innovations:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>start/initiate with a recorded description of what’s going on.</li>
      <ul>
        <li>
          at this point, the UI can have something like WebMD’s Symptom Checker,
          where a human body anatomy is given as an image,
          and then you are given a list of possible feelings/symptoms you might have at that area.
          Instead of symptom checking, this could help the patient synthesize a paragraph
          stating her problem, which is then automatically generated and recorded,
          and the patient should just play it for the doctor.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <li>
        ask the doctor to touch around the area where you have problem,
        until she gets to the exact point where the problem is (this is used instead of patient pointing)
      </li>
      <li>
        Using a language model, such as the one Google uses in Gmail to predict/suggest replies to an email,
        the UI can suggest replies to the doctor’s inquiries.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <div class="button1">
      <form class="bt1" action="UserInterface.html">
        <input type="submit" value="Take me to the UI" />
      </form>
    </div>
