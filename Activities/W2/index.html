    <p>
      We tested and compared pointing performance across two population groups:
      Right-handed vs. Left-handed. <br>
      The two conditions we tested included dominant vs. non-dominant
      hand performance. We had two participants. The right-handed one started the task with the
      dominant hand, followed by the left-handed one who started the task with her non-dominant hand,
      and then the orders were swapped. We did the 1D pointing task on a MacBook using a touchpad, and each
      participant performed 9 times in each condition.
      We found out that the dominant hand had a better performance in such a pointing task.

      Grand throughput:
      <ul>
      <li>dominant hand: 4.43 bits/s</li>
      <li>non-dominant hand: 2.38 bits/s</li>
      </ul>
      Standard deviation:
      <ul>
        <li>dominant hand: 0.73</li>
        <li>non-dominant hand: 0.78</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
